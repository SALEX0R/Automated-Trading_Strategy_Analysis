# Automated Trading Strategy Analysis Toolkit

This GitHub project is an automated trading strategy analysis toolkit designed to assess the effectiveness of trading strategies using Python and Pandas. The toolkit includes two main components: analysis code and drawdown visualization code.

## Features

- **Analysis Code (`a1pha.ipynb`):**
  - Calculate the Sharpe Ratio for performance evaluation.
  - Compute the Average Annual Rate of Interest to measure returns.
  - Generate comprehensive trade sheets to assess trading strategy performance.

- **Drawdown Code (`TA1.ipynb`):**
  - Visualize drawdown, an essential aspect of risk management in trading.
